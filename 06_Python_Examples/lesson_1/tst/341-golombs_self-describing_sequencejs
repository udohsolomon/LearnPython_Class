// GOLOMB'S SELF-DESCRIBING SEQUENCE
// http://projecteuler.net/problem=341
// The Golomb's self-describing sequence {G(n)} is the only nondecreasing sequence of natural numbers such that n appears exactly G(n) times in the sequence. The values of G(n) for the first few n are
// n123456789101112131415…G(n)122334445556666…
// You are given that G(103) = 86, G(106) = 6137.
// You are also given that ΣG(n3) = 153506976 for 1 ≤ n < 103.
// Find ΣG(n3) for 1 ≤ n < 106.
