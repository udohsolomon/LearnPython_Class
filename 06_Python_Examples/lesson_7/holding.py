# There are majorly three things one can do with python object
#although it does has some consequences like `spelling errors` etc
# Another interesting thing about object is that methods are layered on the 
# get-set-del 
# The getattr and setattr functions open up a possibility of creating
# pretty generic piece of code 

# 1. Get an attribute h.name
# 2. Set an attribute  h.shares = 75
# 3. Delete an attribute del h.shares
